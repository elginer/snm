          \n   usage: 
          \n      snm documentation_source_directory options*
          \n
          \n   Where options* stands for zero or more of the options below.
          \n
          \n   Note:
          \n      Only one output format is permitted per invocation.
          \n      If -d or --dump is used, snm will not write a file unless -o or 
          \n      --output is  used.
          \n      There can be no whitespace between -o and its argument, nor can
          \n      there be whitespace between --output= and its argument.
          \n      If no arguments are given to -o, then the file written will have 
          \n      the same filename as the documentation source directory, with an 
          \n      appropriate extension added.
          \n      snm will always add an appropriate extension to output files.
          \n      By default, snm will produce xhtml, and act as if the user had 
          \n      specified -o without an argument.
          \n
          \n      -d               --dump                  Print output to stdout.
          \n      -o[A file name]  --output[=A file name]  Write output to a file.  
          \n                                               Multiple outputs ignored, 
          \n                                               printing warning to 
          \n                                               stderr.
          \n      -h               --help                  Print usage information
          \n      -t               --text, --txt           Text output.
          \n      -x               --xhtml, --html         Output in xhtml format."
