   - "If you use snm and need more help than is available in this manual then do not hesitate to contact the author at spoon@killersmurf.com."
   - "Please note that snm suffers from a number of shortfalls:"
   - "Invalid xhtml can be generated through manipulation of the {section style sheet style}, {section literal text literal}, {section link destinations links}, and the {section unique names of sections sections}."
   - "While I regret that this is possible, attempting xhtml kludges through these means ill-fitting means is misuse of snm and may result in generation of shoddy manuals, a telling off and early bed-times all around.  You have been warned!"
   - "Other problems:"
   - "snm will not check that your section links actually point anywhere."
   - "section numbering is difficult at the moment."
   - "Track these issues at the {external repository http://github.com/elginer/snm}"
