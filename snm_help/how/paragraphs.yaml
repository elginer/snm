title: Paragraphs
number: 3
unique: paragraphs
text:
   - "When a sequence of paragraphs is called for in a manual yaml file, either a single text element, or a yaml {external sequence http://yaml.kwiki.org/index.cgi?YamlInFiveMinutesMinuteOne} is expected."
   - "Paragraphs are not just plain text:  they may contain {section inline elements inline} like hyperlinks or literal text."
   - "In a produced manual, a series of paragraphs are rendered with two line breaks between each of them.  This corresponds to two newline characters in a text document, and being within a <p> tag in an html document.  An example:"
   - class: example
     wrap: False
     text: "   This is a valid, although boring, paragraph."
   - "Paragraphs can be associated with a class, using a yaml {external map http://yaml.kwiki.org/index.cgi?YamlInFiveMinutesMinuteTwo}.  When rendering xhtml documents, this class is becomes the value of the class attribute for the paragraph produced.  This is useful when working using a {section style sheet style}.  An example:"
   - class: example
     wrap: False
     text: "   class: curved_corner
          \n   text: This paragraph is a bit more exciting, because it is being given curved corners by css!"
   - "Word wrapping can be turned on or off on a paragraph basis, by setting wrap to True or false in a map paragraph.  When emitting xhtml, if wrap is off, then all spaces are replaced by &nbsp; and all new-lines replaced by <br/>.  By default wrapping is on. Example:"
   - "This paragraph..."
   - class: example
     wrap: False
     text: "   wrap: False
          \n   text: \"Hey ho,
          \n          \\n  let's go!\""
   - "Is rendered as:"
   - class: example
     wrap: False
     text: "   \"Hey ho,
          \n        let's go!\""
   - "But this paragraph..."
   - class: example
     wrap: False
     text: "   wrap: True
          \n   text: \"Hey ho,
          \n          \\n  let's go!\""
   - "And this paragraph..."
   - class: example
     wrap: False
     text: "   \"Hey ho,
          \n    \\n  let's go!\""
   - "Are rendered as:"
   - class: example
     wrap:  False
     text: "   Hey ho, let's go!"
