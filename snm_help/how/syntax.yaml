title: Syntax Highlighting
number: 7
unique: syntax
text:
   - "snm supports extensible syntax highlighting through dynamically loaded plugins."
   - "Once a highlighting plugin is set up for a language, the language may be used in a {section paragraph paragraphs} or in an {section inline language element language}"
   - "Syntax highlighting is configured through the top-level syntax.yaml file."
   - "This file contains either a syntax map, or a sequence of such maps."
   - "The syntax map has four elements:"
   - "language: The name of the language.  It gives a name to the syntax highlighter in the document."
   - "package: The name of the Haskell package providing the plugin.  Version number included."
   - "module: The name of the module providing the plugin."
   - "symbol: The name of the plugin."
   - "Syntax plugins must have type {class Dynamic example}.  However, this type must have been constructed from a {class SyntaxHighlighter example}, defined in snm's {class Manual.Structure example}."
   - "snm provides a module {class Text.Syntax.Simple example} which makes it easy to write keyword-oriented syntax highlighters."
   - "Be aware that snm will not html escape strings returned by the syntax highlighter.  {class Text.XHtml.Strict.stringToHtmlString example} from the {external xhtml package http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xhtml} may be useful."
   - "As an example, here is this document's syntax.yaml:"
   - class: example
     wrap: False
     text:
        "   language: math
       \n   package: snmmath-0.0.1
       \n   module: Text.Syntax.Math
       \n   symbol: math"
   - "{external snmmath is hosted on github, too http://github.com/elginer/snm_math}."
