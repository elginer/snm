title: Inline Elements
number: 5
unique: inline
text:
   - "Inline elements within paragraphs and banners allow more expressive text.  The idea of an inline snm element is roughly equivalent to an inline HTML element.  Much as an xhtml anchor can only appear within an xhtml block element, an inline element can only appear within an snm paragraph or banner."
   - "Inline elements appear within curly braces \{ }."
   - "If you need to actually write an opening brace in your document, the opening brace may be escaped with a backslash \."
   - "The following inline elements are available: section links, external links and literal text."
