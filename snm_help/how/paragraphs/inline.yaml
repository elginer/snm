   - "Inline elements within paragraphs allow more expressive text.  The idea of an inline snm element is roughly equivalent to an inline HTML element.  Much as an xhtml anchor can only appear within an xhtml block element, an inline element can only appear within an snm paragraph."
   - "Inline elements appear within curly braces \{ }.  When writing a paragraph, the opening brace may be escaped with a backslash \, which will result in a literal opening brace."
   - "The following inline elements are available: section links, external links and literal text."
